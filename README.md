## How to run ?
I've uploaded the 'src' and 'public' directories with their files. They contain the necessary code of the application. Rest of the files and directories like 'node modules' were not uploaded because of their large size and because they are standard packages and files that are created by default in any React project.
Just create a React Project in your system, replace the 'public' and 'src' directories with the above, and that's it !!
